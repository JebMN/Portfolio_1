                <h3>NAS Project</h3>
                <p> Here is my NAS Server project that I did a few years ago.
                    I used an old Dell desktop computer, old hard drives I had salvaged
                    and bought other new components for example its RAM and a few 
                    larger 4 TB hard drives for it. 
                <br>
                    Note the video is 4 years old and a few modifications have been 
                    made to it since.
        
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Specs : 
                <br>
                OS : True NAS
                <br>
                CPU : Intel Xeon 3600
                <br>
                RAM : 24 GB DDR3
                <br>
                Storage : 24 TB HDD | 250GB SSD
                <br>
                GPU : RX 350
                </p>
                <br> 
                <p>
                Though the specs arent the craziest , this NAS server was meant to be 
                an experiment, and it stills works completely fine although there have been issues 
                with ip addresses etc.

                <h3>Custom Monitor</h3>
                <p>This was my custom monitor that I had made from an old broken laptops
                    monitor and had fitted it up with a new control board.
                    I had used wood to make the frame of the monitor and at the end
                    since I had space between the actual backboard and frame , it had 
                    in my opionion a really cool "Glow effect" around the monitor.

                <h3>Flashing ceiling light</h3>
                <p>This project is about creating an added feature to my ceiling light.
                    The feature would be to add an embedded control panel , that allows it for
                    to flash at a set time as fast and "annoyingly" as possible. 
                    The whole reason for this added feature is to wake me up more effectively, 
                    since I have a really tough time waking up in the mornings
